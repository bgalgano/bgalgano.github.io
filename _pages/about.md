I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate at the <a href='https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/'>`Dept. of Physics & Astronomy`</a> at Johns Hopkins. I conduct research at the exciting frontier of machine learning (ML), astrophysics, and cosmology.

My advisor is <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/~mntampaka/'>`Dr. Michelle Ntampaka`</a> at the Data Science Mission Office at <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/'>`Space Telescope Science Institute`</a>. I've worked in a variety of astrophysics subfields from stellar characterization, to exoplanet detection, to cosmology and the large-scale structure. In ML, I have experience in convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, clustering, and bayesian theory.

Previously, I've earned an MSc degree in 2020 from the <a href='https://www.fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org/'>`Vanderbilt-Fisk Bridge-to-the-Ph.D Program`</a>. I am a proud proponent of diversity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within computer science and physics for higher academia and the local Baltimore community.

When not doing research or coding, I enjoy long-distance running and taking care of my tuxedo cat, Orion.
