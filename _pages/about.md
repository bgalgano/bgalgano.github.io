I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics andmachine learning (ML) and astronomy/astrophysics.  
  
My dissertation advisor is <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/~mntampaka/'>Dr. Michelle Ntampaka</a>. Data Science Mission Office at the Space Telescope Science Institute (<a href='https://www.stsci.edu/'><STScI</a>). I've worked in a variety of astrophysics subfields and wavelengths from stellar characterization (optical/near-IR), to exoplanet detection (optical), to cosmology and the large-scale structure (.
  
Previously, I received my MS degree in physics in 2020, proudly as part of the <a href='https://www.fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org/'>Vanderbilt-Fisk Bridge-to-the-Ph.D Program</a>, where my research advisor was Peter Plavchan. I received my BA in physics from Vanderbilt in 2017 under the guidance of <a href='http://astro.phy.vanderbilt.edu/~stassuk/'>Keivan Stassun</a>.

Besides research, my passions include long-distance running and taking care of my tuxedo cat, Orion.
