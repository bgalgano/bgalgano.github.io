I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics and I study the exciting cross-section of machine learning (ML) and astronomy/astrophysics. More specifically, I study galaxy clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe in order to help constrain cosmology. 
  
  My dissertation advisor is <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/~mntampaka/'>Dr. Michelle Ntampaka</a>, and our work lies under the Data Science Mission Office (DSMO) at the <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/'><Space Telescope Science Institute</a> (STScI). I've worked in a variety of astrophysics subfields and wavelengths from stellar characterization, to exoplanet detection, to cosmology.
<br> 
Previously, I received my MS degree in physics in 2020, proudly as part of the <a href='https://www.fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org/'>Vanderbilt-Fisk Bridge-to-the-Ph.D Program</a>, where my research advisor was Peter Plavchan. I received my BA in physics from Vanderbilt in 2017 under the guidance of <a href='http://astro.phy.vanderbilt.edu/~stassuk/'>Keivan Stassun</a>.

Besides research, a passion of mine is long-distance running and taking care of my tuxedo cat, Orion.
