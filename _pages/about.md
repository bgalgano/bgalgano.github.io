I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate studying exciting cross-section of machine learning (ML) and astronomy/astrophysics. My dissertation advisor is <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/~mntampaka/'>Dr. Michelle Ntampaka</a>, and our work lies under the Data Science Mission Office (DSMO) at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).
