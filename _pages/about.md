I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate at the Dept. of Physics & Astronomy at Johns Hopkins. I study the exciting intersection of machine learning (ML) for astronomy and astrophysics.  

My dissertation advisor is <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/~mntampaka/'>Dr. Michelle Ntampaka</a> at the Data Science Mission Office of the Space Telescope Science Institute (<a href='https://www.stsci.edu/'>STScI</a>). I've worked in a variety of astrophysics subfields from stellar characterization (optical/near-IR), to exoplanet detection (optical), to cosmology and the large-scale structure (X-ray).

Previously, I received my MS degree in physics in 2020 as part of the <a href='https://www.fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org/'>Vanderbilt-Fisk Bridge-to-the-Ph.D Program</a>, where my research advisor was <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/gmuexoplanets/pi?authuser=0'>Peter Plavchan </a>. I received my BA in physics from Vanderbilt in 2017 under the guidance of <a href='http://astro.phy.vanderbilt.edu/~stassuk/'>Keivan Stassun</a>.

Besides research, my passions include long-distance running and taking care of my tuxedo cat, Orion.
