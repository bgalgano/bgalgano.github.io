I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate at the <a href='https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/'>Dept. of Physics & Astronomy</a> at Johns Hopkins University. I conduct research at the exciting intersection of machine learning (ML) and astrophysics. I currently do novel applications of ML for cosmology so that we may get a better understanding of the universe. My dissertation work will also seek to improve ML practices through physics.

My advisor is <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/~mntampaka/'>Dr. Michelle Ntampaka</a> at the Data Science Mission Office at <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/'>`STScI`</a>. I've worked in a variety of astrophysics subfields from stellar characterization, to exoplanet detection, to cosmology and the large-scale structure. I have experience in a variety of ML and statistics tools such as deep convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, clustering, and bayesian theory.

Previously, I've graduated with a MSc in 2020 from the <a href='https://www.fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org/'>`Vanderbilt-Fisk Bridge-to-the-Ph.D Program`</a>. I am a proud proponent of diversity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within computer science and physics for higher academia and the local Baltimore community.

When not doing research or coding, I enjoy long-distance running and taking care of my tuxedo cat, Orion.
